# Netflix Content Analysis Project üì∫

## Overview
This project analyzes Netflix's content library to uncover insights about content trends, geographic distribution, and viewing patterns. It includes a content recommendation system and various visualizations to help understand Netflix's content strategy.

## Features
- üìà **Content Trends Analysis**: Track the growth of Netflix's library over time and analyze the impact of COVID-19 on content production
- üåç **Geographic Analysis**: Explore content distribution across different countries and regions
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Duration Analysis**: Understand patterns in movie lengths and TV show seasons
- üìù **Content Description Analysis**: WordCloud visualization of common themes in content descriptions
- üéØ **Content Recommendation System**: Get personalized content recommendations based on title similarity
